# fmcpp2

A naive [cpp2](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront) source formatting script, made in an evening without any thought put in it. 
It assumes a relatively well formatted existing code (donâ€™t expect multi-line formatting, or semantics etc..), just deals with indenting and spacing of the most commonly used operators. 

Requires a compiler supporting c++20: 
```
g++ -std=c++20 -O2  fmcpp2.cpp -o fmcpp2 && ./fmcpp2 source_file.cpp2

```
Uncomment   ```//ln.printBeforeAfter(i); ``` to see the line-by-line before/after on the terminal.
